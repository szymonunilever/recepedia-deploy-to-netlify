## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    yarn install
    yarn run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

2.  **How to develop component to move it to library in future**
    Place all the reusable components wich will be moved to library later to 'src/components/lib'.
    Please check 'src/components/lib/Example':
     1. Example.tsx is the file where the component logic is stored.
     2. partials folder is for component's partials. Please only add it when any partials are needed.
     3. utils.ts is for component's utils. Please only add it when any utils are needed.
     4. models.ts is for components' Typescript models. <Component>Props is mandatory to have. 'className' prop is mandatory, it is needed to be able to style component from outside as soon as there will be no styling in library at all.
     5. __tests__ folder is for tests.

3. **Run Tests**
    ```sh
    yarn run test
    ```

4. **Precommit hooks**
  Husky is used for precommit hook. Check .huskyrc for configuration. Typechecking, linting and test will be run. This can be changed in future if committing takes too long.

 ## Known issues
 Do not upgrade **gatsby-image** package. 
 From **v2.1.0** it uses browser native lazy loading for images. Chrome native lazy loading use hardcoded values for Load-in distance threshold. Because of this, images are loading earler then need and it affects site performance.
